# get_next_line  

get_next_line is a function written in C that reads a file line by line, making it easy to process file content incrementally. The function is capable of handling files, standard input (stdin), or any valid file descriptor, and it ensures efficient memory management while reading the content.

## How It Works  
1. **File Descriptor Handling**  
   - The function takes a file descriptor as an input and reads the file or input stream using the `read` system call.  

2. **Buffer Management**  
   - A static buffer is used to store leftover data between function calls, ensuring no data is lost when a line spans multiple reads.  

3. **Line Construction**  
   - The function continuously appends characters to construct a complete line until a newline (`\n`) character is encountered or the end of the file is reached.  

4. **Edge Cases and Limitations**  
   - Handles empty files and lines ending with a newline character or EOF.  
   - Properly manages memory allocation and deallocation to avoid leaks.  

## What I Learned  
- How to use the `read` system call effectively for reading data from a file descriptor.  
- Techniques for managing static variables to retain state between function calls.  
- Efficient memory handling to avoid leaks while ensuring smooth performance.  
- Debugging edge cases like incomplete lines, large files, and unexpected inputs.  
- Building a reusable function that aligns with standard C programming practices.
